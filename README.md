# Universal-proof
A cryptographic instrument for verifiable digital work

## What it is
Proof lets anyone establish authorship and priority of digital files by generating
local cryptographic commitments that can be verified independently.

## What it is not
- Not a blockchain
- Not a storage platform
- Not an IP registry

## How verification works
1. A proof is generated locally from a file
2. The file is never uploaded
3. Anyone can verify a file against a proof using mathematics
